## 👋 About me   

I’m a **Data Analyst** with **3+ years of experience** working with complex **healthcare and research datasets**, using **SQL for data extraction** and **Python for analysis** to support data-driven decision-making at scale.

I have a strong foundation in **Statistics, Python and SQL**, with hands-on experience working with real-world public health data.

**What I work with:**
- Data cleaning, validation and preprocessing (Python, SQL)
- Statistical analysis (regression, hypothesis testing, trend analysis)
- Data visualization & dashboards (Tableau, Power BI)

I’ve supported data-driven decision-making at non-governmental organizations with a focus on **data quality assessment, Key Performance Indicator (KPI) monitoring and reporting**.
I am currently deepening my knowledge by pursuing a **Master's in Data Analaytics** at Clark University.
Here on GitHub, I share projects related to **data analytics, SQL, statistics, and visualization** with an emphasis on practical, impact-driven analysis.
